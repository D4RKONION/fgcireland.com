The Irish Fighting Game Community (IFGC) is a group of players, organizers & streamers from across Ireland dedicated to competitive fighting games. We host a wide range of in-person events (both weekly and monthly) in cities like Dublin, Cork, Belfast, and Galway.

### Games
Our biggest communities are centered around Street Fighter, Tekken, Guilty Gear, UNI & Smash; but rest assured you will find players for even the most niche titles from retro games like CvS2 to indie entries like Iron Saga VS.  

### Discord
We stay connected through [multiple discord servers]({{< ref "/discords/index.md" >}}) where players gather to discuss matchups, share tech, and organize games. Our communities are inclusive and welcoming so whether you're a seasoned competitor or just getting started, there's a place for you to start getting involved.

### Events
Monthly tournaments, regular locals, and online brackets are regularly run, covering titles across all major fighting game franchises. These events are open for anyone to enter, and you can check out what's coming up in your area on [our events page]({{< ref "/events/index.md" >}}).

### History
Although there were Fighting Games being played in the arcades of Dublin as far back as the 90s, the Irish FGC as we know it today was established in 2009. With the release of Street Fighter 4, a small group of dedicated players managed to convince boards.ie to open the (now defunct) Fighting Game forum that would serve as the central hub for the entire IFGC for around 8 years.

The last weekend of October was a busy one for the Irish FGC, with events in Dublin and Cork in addition to Belfast - not to mention the small matter of IGM in Dun Laoghaire next weekend - so it was unsurprising that turnout for the October edition of Button Mash was down on August. That said, there was still a new game on show, as well as a game that was decidedly not new, but was new to Button Mash.

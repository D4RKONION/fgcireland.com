The last weekend of October was a busy one for the Irish FGC, with events in [Dublin](https://www.start.gg/tournament/craicdown-12/details) and [Cork](https://www.start.gg/tournament/leeside-collision-34/details) in addition to Belfast - not to mention the small matter of [IGM](https://www.irishgamingmarket.ie/) in Dun Laoghaire next weekend - so it was unsurprising that turnout for the October edition of Button Mash was down on August. That said, there was still a new game on show, as well as a game that was decidedly not new, but it was new to Button Mash. Let's check out how it went down:

# 2XKO

(6 players/[Bracket](https://www.start.gg/tournament/button-mash-october-2025/event/2xko/brackets/2085788/3047432)/[VOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euwmNAOxplc&t=76s))

2XKO was one of two games to be run as a round robin, and a closer tournament you couldn't possibly have asked for, as **Lianoc** (Yasuo/Jinx), **Mini_Kai** (Vi/Darius), and **Kaworuscott** (Braum/Illaoi) all finished on a 4-1 record. On account of his superior game count, Lianoc was declared the inaugural Button Mash 2XKO champion.

![2XKO results: 1) Lianoc (Yasuo/Jinx), 2) Mini_Kai (Vi/Darius), 3) Kaworuscott (Braum/Illaoi), 4) Pennma (Vi/Illaoi), 5) Luci2k1 (Vi/Jinx), 6) Azhar (Ahri/Ekko)](/images/uploads/posts/button-mash-october-2025-double-the-kos-double-the-guilt/button-mash-oct-25-top8-2xko.jpg)

# Street Fighter 6

(9 players/[Bracket](https://www.start.gg/tournament/button-mash-october-2025/event/street-fighter-6/brackets/2078274/3037829)/[VOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euwmNAOxplc&t=4853s))

With none of August's top 3 in attendance, it was all to play for in the SF6 bracket. Indeed, most sets were closely contested, with few in the way of 3-0 sweeps. **Cobalt Frog** put on a good show with newly-released, highly-technical DLC character C. Viper, but could only manage third place after being on the receiving end of a thrilling comeback in the losers' final against **Kaworuscott** (Marisa). This put Kaworuscott into the grand final against **Mr Potato** (Jamie), with Mr Potato coming out on top in another tight match.

![SF6 results: 1) Mr Potato (Jamie), 2) Kaworuscott (Marisa), 3) Cobalt Frog (C. Viper), 4) Friezer (Ken), 5) Yreval (Mai), Azhar (Rashid), 7) Pennma (Marisa), Neb (JP)](/images/uploads/posts/button-mash-october-2025-double-the-kos-double-the-guilt/button-mash-oct-25-top8-sf6.jpg)

# Guilty Gear Strive

(10 players/[Bracket](https://www.start.gg/tournament/button-mash-october-2025/event/guilty-gear-strive/brackets/2078273/3037828)/[VOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euwmNAOxplc&t=9235s))

**Jo** (Testament) survived a bracket reset from **Mattie** (Ky/Lucy/Potemkin) to take top spot in GGST. After losing a super-close winners' final to Jo, Mattie went on a tear, delivering consecutive 3-0 beatdowns to **Mr Potato** (Chipp) and Jo, but in the grand final reset his momentum petered out as Jo reasserted his superiority.

![GGST results: 1) Jo (Testament), 2) Mattie (Ky), 3) Mr Potato (Chipp), 4) Friezer (Bridget), 5) MasterEdgelord0 (Venom), Kaworuscott (Bridget), 7) Mini_Kai (Ky), the.windows (Elphelt)](/images/uploads/posts/button-mash-october-2025-double-the-kos-double-the-guilt/button-mash-oct-25-top8-strive.jpg)

# Tekken 8

(6 players/[Bracket](https://www.start.gg/tournament/button-mash-october-2025/event/tekken-8/brackets/2078275/3037830)/[VOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euwmNAOxplc&t=13825s))

With a much-reduced turnout from August, Tekken 8 was the other round robin tournament of the day. This one was somewhat more cut and dried than 2XKO, with **Skeletorr** (Armor King) dropping only a single game to second-placed **Friezer** (Clive) on his way to a dominant victory. **Kaworuscott** (Leroy) finished in third place.

![T8 results: 1) Skeletorr (Armor King), 2) Friezer (Clive), 3) Kaworuscott (Leroy), 4) Snidecnut (Azucena), 5) Yreval (Alisa), 6) Neb (Yoshimitsu)](/images/uploads/posts/button-mash-october-2025-double-the-kos-double-the-guilt/button-mash-oct-25-top8-t8.jpg)

# Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R

(6 players/[Bracket](https://www.start.gg/tournament/button-mash-october-2025/event/accent-core-r/brackets/2088528/3050763)/[VOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euwmNAOxplc&t=15803s))

This time around it was the turn of GGXXAC+R to fill the throwback game slot, and just like its successor it provided a thrilling winners' final and a bracket reset. **Yreval** (May) narrowly defeated **Kaworuscott** (Zappa) 3-2 in the winners final, but Kaworuscott locked in for the rest of the tournament, defeating **Mr Potato** (Order Sol/Potemkin/Chipp) 3-0 in the losers' final, winning the first rematch against Yreval 3-0, and unlike Mattie in GGST, he finished the job with a 3-1 win in the grand final reset.

# What next?

Button Mash will return on **Sunday the 7th of December**, in the Accidental Theatre, with GGST, SF6, T8, and two other games to be confirmed nearer the date. Not only that, but [Button Mash Online Fundraiser: Tekken 8 Edition](https://www.start.gg/tournament/bmo-fundraiser-tekken-8-edition/details) is set for **Wednesday the 5th of November**. Last but not least, the Belfast weekly locals hosted by QUB Dragonslayers are moving to Saturdays for the foreseeable future, although they will not be taking place this forthcoming Saturday the 1st of November owing to IGM. As always, keep checking the [Button Mash socials](https://linktr.ee/buttonmashni) for the latest info.

*GGXXAC+R wasn't the only throwback game on show: there was casual games of Tekken 3 and Capcom vs SNK 2, and your author had a set against WonderDownUnder in Super Gem Fighter, a game in which, among other things, [Sakura can summon a couple of muscle men in Speedos to drag her opponent off screen and beat them up.](https://youtu.be/io7iMOGWEoI&t=58) Video games - don't worry about it.*

The last weekend of October was a busy one for the Irish FGC, with events in Dublin and Cork in addition to Belfast - not to mention the small matter of IGM in Dun Laoghaire next weekend - so it was unsurprising that turnout for the October edition of Button Mash was down on August. That said, there was still a new game on show, as well as a game that was decidedly not new, but was new to Button Mash. Let's check out how it went down:

# 2XKO

(6 players/[Bracket](https://www.start.gg/tournament/button-mash-october-2025/event/2xko/brackets/2085788/3047432)/[VOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euwmNAOxplc&t=76s))

2XKO was one of two games to be run as a round robin, and a closer tournament you couldn't possibly have asked for, as **Lianoc** (Yasuo/Jinx), **Mini_Kai** (Vi/Darius), and **Kaworuscott** (Braum/Illaoi) all finished on a 4-1 record. On account of his superior game count, Lianoc was declared the inaugural Button Mash 2XKO champion.

# Street Fighter 6

(9 players/[Bracket](https://www.start.gg/tournament/button-mash-october-2025/event/street-fighter-6/brackets/2078274/3037829)/[VOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euwmNAOxplc&t=4853s))

With none of August's top 3 in attendance, it was all to play for in the SF6 bracket. Indeed, most sets were closely contested, with few in the way of 3-0 sweeps. **Cobalt Frog** put on a good show with newly-released, highly-technical DLC character C. Viper, but could only manage third place after being on the receiving end of a thrilling comeback in the losers' final against **Kaworuscott** (Marisa). This put Kaworuscott into the grand final against **Mr Potato** (Jamie), with Mr Potato coming out on top in another tight match.

Button Mash returned to the Accidental Theatre on the first weekend of December for a Sunday tournament, which meant a reduced turnout, but the action was no less intense for it. Here's how it went down:

# Street Fighter 6

(4 player round robin/[Bracket](https://www.start.gg/tournament/button-mash-december-2025/event/street-fighter-6/brackets/2122585/3095042))

**Pennma**'s Marisa kept the SNK invaders at arm's length with a clean sweep of this round robin tournament. **Yreval** claimed second place after coming out on top in a Terry mirror against **CJ**, while **Skeletorr** (Mai) finished in fourth.

# Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising

**Mister_Finer** (Sandalphon/Siegfried/Belial) was the class of the field as he racked up three consecutive 3-0 victories to win the GBVSR tournament, with **Pennma** (Soriz/Wilnas/Ladiva) completing a thrilling comeback over **Yreval** (Anila) to secure second place.

# Tekken 8

In the only tournament to see an increased turnout compared to its previous running, **Raff** (Bryan) was taken to a grand final reset by **outterest** (Hwoarang), but eventually claimed the tournament victory to add to his win in last month's Button Mash Online event. outterest qualified by beating **ChickenChakra** (Clive) in the losers' final, despite having lost to him in the winners' bracket.

# Guilty Gear Strive

For the second Button Mash in a row, **Jo** (Testament) claimed victory - and this time, he did so without dropping a single game, as he thwarted **Mister_Finer**'s (Johnny) attempt to win his second tournament of the day. Third place went to **MasterEdgelord0** (Venom).

# Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3

In this event's throwback game, **Skeletorr** (Sektor) defeated **Pennma** (Sheeva) in a close grand final. Skeletorr quickly went 2-0 up, but had to survive a fightback from Pennma who levelled the score before Skeletorr claimed the deciding game. **WonderDownUnder** (Smoke) came in third.

# What next?

At time of writing, the date of the next Button Mash event has yet to be decided, and our Saturday sessions at QUB Dragonslayers are on a Christmas break. As usual, keep an eye on the [Button Mash socials](https://linktr.ee/buttonmashni) for the latest updates.

## Intro

Ireland had an incredible showing this VSF, with our strongest players making it into Top 8's for both GGST and UNI2. Many players also made it out of pools, doing some serious damage in the process, demonstrating to a wider audience the talent which forms in the crucible of Ireland. This article will go over the placements of Irish players in Versus Fighting XIII's Anime brackets, along with an honourable mention.

## GGST

**IRISH PLACEMENTS:**

*Mattie = 5TH*\
*Skarfelt = 9TH*\
*Carbattery = 13TH*\
*Flood = 33RD*\
*chainsawxangel = 33RD*\
*Mister_Finer = 33RD*\
*Alumento = 49TH*\
*Orion = 65TH*

Ireland's favourite game at VSF was bound to have a good showing, but what we came away with was more than impressive. Orion had a good run despite a very tough path, in which he clashed with Leffen in Round 2 of Winners, and similarly Alumento had a strong performance which was cut short by a brutal bracket putting him in the path of GideonTG and blertsmile. Six Irish players managed to make it out of pools, and on to the second day of competition. Among them Flood, chainsawxangel & Mister_Finer would go down in Round 1 of Top 48. Carbattery blasted though winners side until he met Precho, ending up in 13th, an incredible placement for his first tournament abroad. Skarfelt took Leffen to game 5, securing themselves 9th. Mattie reached top 8, becoming a crowd favourite, with chants and cheers and cries sounding out the arena during his "Mattie Rounds", with which he would eventually reach 5th.

## Intro

Ireland had an incredible showing this VSF, with our strongest players making it into Top 8's for both GGST and UNI2. Many players also made it out of pools, doing some serious damage in the process, demonstrating to a wider audience the talent which forms in the crucible of Ireland. This article will go over the placements of Irish players in Versus Fighting XIII's Anime brackets, along with an honourable mention.

## GGST / 150 Entrants

**IRISH PLACEMENTS:**

*Mattie = 5TH*\
*Skarfelt = 9TH*\
*Carbattery = 13TH*\
*Flood = 33RD*\
*chainsawxangel = 33RD*\
*Mister_Finer = 33RD*\
*Alumento = 49TH*\
*Orion = 65TH*

Ireland's favourite game at VSF was bound to have a good showing, but what we came away with was more than impressive. Orion had a good run despite a very tough path, in which he clashed with Leffen in Round 2 of Winners, and similarly Alumento had a strong performance which was cut short by a brutal bracket putting him in the path of GideonTG and blertsmile. Six Irish players managed to make it out of pools, and on to the second day of competition. Among them Flood, chainsawxangel & Mister_Finer would go down in Round 1 of Top 48. Carbattery blasted though winners side until he met Precho, ending up in 13th, an incredible placement for his first tournament abroad. Skarfelt took Leffen to game 5, securing themselves 9th. Mattie reached top 8, becoming a crowd favourite, with chants and cheers and cries sounding out the arena during his "Mattie Rounds", with which he would eventually reach 5th.

**PANDAMONIUM / 31 Entrants**

**IRISH PLACEMENTS:**

*Alumento = 4TH*\
*Mister_Finer = 7TH*\
*Orion = 17TH*\
*Flood = 17TH*

On the Sunday of VSF, some of the GGST players decided to set up a little casual bracket which quickly bloomed into a 31 person post-local. Of this bracket Ireland had some very strong placements, with Orion and Flood getting 17th (Flood specifically wanted me to mention that she lost to two Potemkins (Fraud Laust Alert)), Mister_Finer making it all the way to Top 8 before being knocked out by Volta Antares, and Alumento securing 4th before dropping to GekkoSquirrel.

## GBVSR / 126 Entrants

**IRISH PLACEMENTS:**

*Grumm = 17TH*\
*Orion = 33RD*\
*Pyro_ = 49TH*\
*Mister_Finer = 65TH*

Granblue is a game which has had very few in person tournaments across Ireland, although it has seen some online attention recently through Orion's "Monday Night Granball" which is hosted in the [Eiredashers Discord](https://fgcireland.com/discords/). Mister\_Finer took 65th, with Pyro\_ making a run through losers, barely scraping the edge of top 48 in a 2-3 set against Pizza time. Orion had a great run through losers to get 33rd after a Round 1 Irish teamkill from Grumm, who went on to reach top 24 in a very impressive showing.

## UNI2 / 55 Entrants

**IRISH PLACEMENTS:**

*Dr K = 5TH*\
*Mister_Finer = 33RD*\
*Orion = 33RD*

UNI2 had a splash of Irish talent, and a recent push from community members to give it more time in sun leads me to believe it has bright future full of photosynthesis. Out in 33rd was Mister_Finer and Orion, both managing to do some damage in a game which they are quite unfamiliar with. The star of the show here is Dr K, Ireland's resident lab monster and a leader of the recent UNI2 resurgence, who grabbed 5th in some very exciting horse-related matches.

## HONOURABLE MENTIONS

**IRISH PLACEMENTS:**

**TEKKEN BALL / 43 Entrants**\
*Orion = 4TH*\

In an unexpected turn of events, Seán is goated at Tekken Ball. Using Law 1+2 he made his way confident to 4th, for which he received a medal and an invitation, as a notable Tekken Ball player, to the European Tekken Ball Discord.

**SF6 / 250 Entrants**\
*Neilo = 49TH*

**TEKKEN 8 / 242 Entrants**\
*Hench Man Hoey = 17TH*

Hench Man Hoey had a stellar performance to achieve Top 24

**FATAL FURY: COTW / 70 Entrants**\
*Neilo = 33RD*

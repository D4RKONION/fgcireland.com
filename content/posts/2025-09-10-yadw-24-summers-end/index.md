## Smash shoutouts
Smash is back with a vengeance this week, with a massive 18 person bracket. Truly this is the final sign that Irish summer is over, and sure enough the weather deteriorated the next day. Shoutouts to the smash top 3 of TheGreg, Hackle Serpent & Silver Bullet!

## UNI

Another bumper week for UNI as well, the anime scene showing that its appetite for competition is unwaning. A full 16 person bracket was underway, and Dr. K's reign of terror has finally been put to an end by Naphiel with newcomer Unika!

## SF6

A quiet week for SF6, but competition was still fierce with Damigod taking his first YADW bracket victory, defeating Skyozer in grand finals! This continues our streak of having a different player win SF6 every week, which is impressive stuff.

## YADW 25

Want to take part yourself? We play every second Tuesday in The Back Page, Phibsborough, Dublin. If you're a GGST or T8 player, you should definitely come along to [YADW 25, sign-ups open now](https://start.gg/yadw)! **All skill levels** are welcome and bracket entry goes towards the community fund for new equipment/software purchases.

## YADW 26

Also some advanced warning that YADW 26 will feature UNI as usual, but a new warrior is entering the ring; 2XKO will be joining our roster of games! This will replace SF6 for the time being. Hopefully not for too long though, watch this space...

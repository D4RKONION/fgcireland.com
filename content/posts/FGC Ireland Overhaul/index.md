The new and improved fgcreland.com, now with posts!
{{< /lead >}}

## New and shiny

Hello! Welcome to the new and improved FGCIreland.com! I decided to rewrite the site from scratch using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) (a cool static site generator) and the [Blowfish theme](https://blowfish.page). Hopefully you find the new look as pleasing as I do! You can see our lovely new homepage [here](https://fgcireland.com).

## But why?

My main motivation for the rewrite is to get this very posting feature you're reading right now! I wanted somewhere more permanent for the IFGC to post its various updates, without them being locked in one particular discord server. Hopefully this means it's easier to share hype announcements, tournament round ups, community updates for the various regions, travel blogs for overseas events etc. For now, watch this space...

## Can I post?

How kind of you to ask! While I'm currently reaching out to community members to take part, you're free to send me a DM on Discord and I'll see what I can do.

## Open sourced

This website's source code is open for anyone to use, if you're interested in using it for your own community, [go ahead](https://github.com/D4RKONION/fgcireland.com)!

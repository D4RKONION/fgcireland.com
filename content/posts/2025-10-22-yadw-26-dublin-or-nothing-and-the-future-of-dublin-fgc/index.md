There's a lot to get through, so let's jump in!

## YADW 26

YADW 26 was a brilliant event to wrap up "a year worth of YADWs". We started running FGC events consistently at YADW last October, and since then we've achieved a lot. We've gone from 1 game per event to 2, we've settled into a consistent routine, bought loads of communitiy equipment, and brought the Dublin FGC back to life. This has been a group effort with a lot of people involved and I want to thank everyone who has pitched in. In particular, thank you to Average for his hard work in communicating with the venue.

I'm not going to do a detailed breakdown of the events from last YADW, but shoutouts to our first 2XKO top 3 of Dr. K, Alumento & Voa!

## Dublin Or Nothing 1

In case you missed it, the Dublin FGC is now running its own event one Tuesday per month called Dublin or Nothing. The main difference between this event and YADW is that there's no Smash running, so we have more room to run games and that we receive all funds generated by the event. This means we can get more equipment bought sooner, and look torwards running a weekend event more easily (watch this space!)

Our first Dublin or Nothing ran 2XKO, Tekken 8, and UNI. Everything went extremely smoothly, and though we are excited to try running 4 games at this event, we'll stick to 3 games for the first few months to make sure that we can handle the numbers.

## The Future

With YADW and Dublin or Nothing happening every second Tuesday, there's no shortage of events for midweek games in the capital city! We are currently exploring ways to bring back proper FGC focussed events at the weekend, but we're still a little short on equipment for that. Watch this space for fundraising events, and annoucements on that front!

## Upcoming Events

Want to take part yourself? We play every second Tuesday in The Back Page, Phibsborough, Dublin. If you're a Strive or Granblue player, you should definitely come along to [YADW 27, sign-ups open now](https://start.gg/yadw) for Oct 28th!

Dublin or Nothing 2 will take place on Nov 11th in the same venue, link will be at https://start.gg/dublin

## Summer Turn Out

The YADW team were worried that summer might dry out the Dublin FGC for a few months, as has always been the case with weeklies in the capital. Students returning home from college, players heading off on holidays, and fine weather in Dublin tends not to be the greatest combo when it comes to encouraging people to show up to a dark, humid room to play competitive FGs around a bunch of nerds.

But spirits were high, deodorant was applied, and competition was immense at this week's YADW!

## SF6

SF6 continues to bring the crowds, with strong players and newer competitors alike. Squarepheus managed to clutch a tight Winner's Finals V.S. QuirkyTurtle (who made an impressive YADW debut at 3rd place) before a dominating finish V.S. Skyozer in Grand Finals. This marks Square's first YADW win, massive congrats to him!

## UNI

UNI's consistent numbers can't be denied and this week was no different. The players stormed through the bracket; Dr. K continued his reign of terror with a 3-0 victory over Naphiel in Winner's, and a 3-1 win to take Grands in the same match-up. AN2 placed 3rd in what was an extremely competitive bracket as always.

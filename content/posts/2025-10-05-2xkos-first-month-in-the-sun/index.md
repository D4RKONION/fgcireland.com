# How's it feelin'?

Today marks the end of Closed Beta and simultaneously the beginning of Early Access for 2XKO, so I thought'd be a great time to look at how the game's been received throughout Ireland on it's first month.

What's the community sentiment for the game thus far? The game's been played widely and discussed continually from before it's Closed Beta release until today within the [TFI Discord](<>), so that's the perfect place to find out.

 I asked in the TFI Discord for first impressions and thoughts from it's variety of denizens, and they are as follows:

* The game is great at bringing in new players, through things like simplified inputs and pulse combos, which make getting into a tag fighter much less daunting.
* The characters are well adapted from League, with each of them retaining their charm while fitting in well to a fighting game.
* Playing with a duo is so much fun! This is an incredible innovation in the fighting game sphere.
* Each character feels very fleshed out and powerful in their own way.
* Adjusting to playing neutral with assists is quite difficult, especially when people use assists to cover jump ins or backjump to delay for assists.
* It's too easy to roll on wakeup accidentally by holding down back, and holding down to neutral wake up can make it that much more difficult to block when dealing with mix.
* Fury's damage and dash cancels are too oppressive.
* This game is sorely missing local duo vs online play.

# Competers

2XKO appeared in three Irish tournaments the month it's been out â€“ Craicdown, YADW, and Leeside Collision, won by Strawberry, Dr K, and Strawberry again respectively. Charlie LaCroix also placed 13th in France's UFA, out of 156 entrants.

# Conclusions

It is quite loved! There are fair criticisms of balancing and some lacking features, and much praise for it's accessibility, characters, and duo play.

Boasting high entry numbers, strong competitors, and a plethora of support from TO's, the game has already found a home in Ireland before it's full release. It's exciting to imagine what kind of scene 2XKO might create once it becomes easier to access.

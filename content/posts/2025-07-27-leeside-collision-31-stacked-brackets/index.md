## Filled With Killers

A deadly set of players filled the Tribe Dance Hall at Leeside Collision's 31st entry, with the strongest GGST bracket Cork's seen in recent memory. Despite the lower attendance lately, it seems Cork remains a hub for the strongest in the country to compete. See below for a rundown of the brackets along with a gallery from the day.

## Street Fighter 6

Street Fighter 6 ran a round robin bracket to facilitate the lower entry numbers, giving everyone a chance to play longer and more exciting sets. Included in this bracket was Ireland's own Capcom Pro Tour player Brickterium, along with strong Irish players deskmenu and Strawberry, with Brickterium playing extremely convincingly on the day, winning 100% of his sets and only dropping 1 game out of 25 to his brother deskmenu.

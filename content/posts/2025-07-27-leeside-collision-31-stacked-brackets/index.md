## Filled With Killers

A deadly set of players filled the Tribe Dance Hall at Leeside Collision's 31st entry, with the strongest GGST bracket Cork's seen in recent memory. Despite the lower attendance lately, it seems Cork remains a hub for the strongest in the country to compete. See below for a rundown of the brackets along with a gallery from the day.

## Street Fighter 6

Street Fighter 6 ran a round robin bracket to facilitate the lower entry numbers, giving everyone a chance to play longer and more exciting sets. Included in this bracket was Ireland's own Capcom Pro Tour player Brickterium, along with strong Irish players deskmenu and Strawberry, with Brickterium playing extremely convincingly on the day, winning 100% of his sets and only dropping one game out of twenty five to his brother deskmenu.

## GGST

Guilty Gear Strive had an intense bracket, with many players traveling down from Dublin to compete. The skill floor of the scene has reached a high level across Ireland, with every player who made it to the top 8 a contender for the high placement, and every match feeling like it could've gone either way. Cork player chainsawxangel (me (self-glazing session)) managed to take the set against Dr K and Alumento for the first time to grab 4th, and Dublin regular Goronberry put on an incredible show in one of their rare Cork appearances, achieving a confident 3rd. Most notable though is Carbattery losing to Flood in Winner's Finals, a match-up which he has previously looked completely in control of, although he would go on to claw back victory in a nail-biter Grand Final's reset.

## UNI2

UNDER NIGHT IN-BIRTH II Sys:Celes hasn't been run in Cork for quite some time, so many rare players showed up to support it. Top 8 Losers was host to a number of great sets including a close fight between Charlie LaCroix and Dualgas in which Charlie would come out on top, followed by Charlie LaCroix vs Strawberry in which Strawberry would jump between Akatsuki, Hilda & Yuzuriha to narrowly secure 3rd. The battle for top spot between Naphiel and Dr K would be momentarily delayed by a problem of some overheating consoles (which would be resolved using the age old unplug everything technology). Naphiel started from loser's side on Hyde, switching to Carmine to reverse 3-0 in Grands, but Dr K would assert himself the best on the day by winning 3-1 in the reset.

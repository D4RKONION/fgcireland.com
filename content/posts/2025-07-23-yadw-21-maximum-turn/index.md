## Our Biggest Event Yet

An absolutely massive turn out for YADW 21 made it one of the biggest Dublin turnouts in years, at a *Tuesday Local*! With 49 unique entrants, 16 Tekken Players and a massive 20 Strive Players, both brackets ran right up to closing, with some extremely tight matches throughout. Check out the image gallery below to see some snaps I took.

## Tekken 8

Tekken 8 has been struggling in other regions but it appears the Dublin crowd are chomping at the bit for locals. This is the third time in a row that Tekken 8 has achieved at least [16 players](https://www.start.gg/tournament/your-average-dublin-weekly-21/event/tekken-8/brackets/2025649/2965738), and the competition has been intense every time. Outterest lost a close set to Neilo in Winners Finals, only to go 3-2 vs Maverick in Losers and reset Neilo for the win 3-2, 3-2 in what might now be the longest grand finals on record in Ireland. GGs to everyone who attended!

## GGST

Guilty Gear Strive had a few lower than average turn-outs of recent weeks, but clearly they decided to prove that they were still the biggest scene in Dublin. A massive *[20 people](https://www.start.gg/tournament/your-average-dublin-weekly-21/event/guilty-gear-strive-1v1-bracket/brackets/2025650/2965739)* showed up to compete in Strive in what it feels like is our absolute Capacity for an event at The Back Page. Fierce competitors (plus a beleaguered TO) battled it out where Alumento almost made it back through losers side (and many 3-2 matches, including the losers final with Mister Finer) only to be beaten in the reset of Grand Finals by an on-form Flood. GGs!

## Equipment update

A quick Dublin FGC Community equipment update! We've now got our 4 portable monitors AND 2 Xbox Series S, along with the brook adapters for anyone who needs them. This has reduced [our Community Pot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FWPFtyJup71STkagxpbsAnIWbqoDNSEZd7nk634B12s/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to â‚¬0, so we'll spend the next few weeks building it back up before we grab a few more consoles. 

Thank you to everyone who has been bringing laptops and consoles & to everyone who has been attending in such great numbers. We literally couldn't do it without you.

## Next YADW

The next YADW is #22 and will take place August 5th. We'll have UNI and SF6, so we'll see you then!

## Room change

Due to a double booking, we were in the downstairs "gaming room" of The Back Page, but thankfully they accommodated us with lots of space so things went ahead smoothly for YADW 23. Another fiercely competitive evening with our usual high turn out!

## GGST

Another huge turnout for Strive, with a massive 18 players showing up the night before the most recent patch. No doubt there'll be an even bigger turn-out at YADW 25 with what appears to be a popular slew of changes made to the game.

## T8

A full 16 players in our Tekken bracket this week, with some long forgotten players making their return, and fresh faces showing up for battle; including an incredible debut from Kwackman who took down the tournament, despite strong resistance from Esterdante.

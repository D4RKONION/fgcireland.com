## Quarter Centenary

This week marks our 25th event since Dublin locals started back up (a bit less for FGC-featuring YADWs but shhhh). It's been great to help bring Fighting Games back to Dublin, and thank you to everyone who's been helping out at these events; whether that's people helping to run brackets, setting up tables, or just showing up to enjoy the bracket & grab some pizza. Here's to 25 more!

## GGST

With 12 very strong entrants I think this week was the toughest GGST bracket yet. Rubii is back on form after a hiatus playing SF6 and ~~thanks to the help of top tier Zato~~ was able to take third place from the grasps of a low tier playing TO. However it was Flood and Goronberry battling it out in grand finals, with an indomitable Flood taking home the gold yet again. Can anyone stop this Faust playing beast??

## Tekken 8

Do my eyes deceive me, is that *the* Fergus2k8 I see in the bracket? Yes, the king of Irish Tekken made an appearance this week, and out seeking victory over him was none other than ChickenChakra! Along with Outterest, Esterdante, Whatsmyline & Neilo this was an absolute monster of a bracket. Fergus took it in the end but it was a fiercely contested tournament. Can anyone take him down? Maybe next time...
